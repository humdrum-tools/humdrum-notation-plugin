Below is a musical dice game attributed to Mozart (K<sup>6</sup> 516f).  The <a
href="https://kern.humdrum.org/cgi-bin/ksdata?file=k516f.krn&l=users/craig/dice/mozart&format=pdf"
target="_new">original score</a> was printed in a musical magazine
in Berlin around 1790.  Click on measure numbers in the following
grid to construct a score, which will be displayed under the measure
grid.  When no measures are selected, all of the input measures are
displayed.  To play the game, roll two dice at a time to select a specific row
in the grid.  Do this sixteen times to generate a randomized score.
