This page demonstrates how the Humdrum notation plugin can be used to
display multiple small pieces on the same page.  Click on the title
of any song in the list below, and the music notation for the song will
be displayed.  Click on the notation, or title again, and the notation
will be hidden.  Multiple songs can be displayed at the same time.

Also of interest, if you shift-click on a title or music notation, an
online scan of the source edition will be displayed in another browser
window, opened to the source page containing the song.

These songs come from the book <i>Teton Sioux
Music</i> by Frances Densmore, for which a digital
edition of the music is available on <a target="_blank"
href="https://github.com/craigsapp/densmore-teton-sioux">Github</a>
and <a target="_blank"
href="http://kern.humdrum.org/browse?l=folk/sioux">kernScores</a>,
and which is used to generate the notation on this page.
