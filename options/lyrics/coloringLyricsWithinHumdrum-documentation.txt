Here is an example of how to color lyrics of a musical example using
markup embedded directly into the Humdrum data.



```html
{% include_relative lyricColorHumdrum.txt %}
```


{% include_relative lyricColorHumdrum.txt %}


Currently the color control must come before the start of the music.  In the
future, coloring individual words will probably be implemented.
