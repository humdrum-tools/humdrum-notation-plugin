Here is an example of how to color the lyrics of a musical example.
This is not controlled directly by the plugin, but rather with CSS
styling of the resulting SVG image.




```html
{% include_relative lyricColor.txt %}
```


{% include_relative lyricColor.txt %}


The SVG image generated from the musical data is placed into a div element
that matches the ID of the target container, adding an extension of "-svg" to the
base ID.  So in this case the CSS selector `#lyricColor-svg .verse tspan.text` means
to find the container element for the SVG of this example, then within elements having 
a class label of `verse`, set the style of the `tspan` elements that have a class label
of `text` (i.e., where the lyrics are stored in the SVG imges).  In normal HTML content,
text is colored using the `text` CSS attribute; however, in this case the SVG equivalent
is to use `fill` (and for other type of elements, `stroke` may need to be set).
