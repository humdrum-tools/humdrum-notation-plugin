The `lyricSize` option can be used to control the size of lyrics relative to
the size of the music.  The default size is 4.5 diatonic steps:

```html
{% include_relative lyricSize-default.txt -%}
```

{% include_relative lyricSize-default.txt %}

The minimum size is 2 diatonic steps:

```html
{% include_relative lyricSize-min.txt -%}
```

{% include_relative lyricSize-min.txt %}

and maximum size is 8 diatonic steps:

```html
{% include_relative lyricSize-max.txt -%}
```

{% include_relative lyricSize-max.txt %}

In this case the larger text forces the music to be spaced wider, so
the `inicipit` option is given to prevent displaying the overflow music.
Also notice that the tempo designation, **Slow** (and probably other types
of text on the page), is affected by the `lyricSize` option.
